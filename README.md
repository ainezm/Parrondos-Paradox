# Parrondos-Paradox
Game Theory Simulator of Parrondos Paradox

## Experiment with Time and Capital Variant Parrondo's Paradox

The code TimeVariantGame.py and CapitalVariantGame.py when run, will by default generate random games until one that exhibits Parrondo's paradox is found. Then it runs and graphs a simulation of the game.

The classes are versatile, and can simulate any arbitrary game. To modify a game, set the class variables directly. We have included functions to solve the game once it has been set. Alternatively, the function set_game() will randomly initialize a game.

## Experiment on quantum walk
The code here can let you modify some parameters in the experiments. Including:

1. The parameter of the coin

2. The length of the sequence and the texture of the sequence (here you can try any sequence with out the assumption that you can only play A at time nq)

3. The episode of the experiment

4. The initial coin state


The result with be shown as a graph with P_R-P_L changing with the episode of the iteration.
