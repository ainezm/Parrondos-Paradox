Game Theory Simulator of Parrondos Paradox

## Experiment on quantum walk
The code here can let you modify some parameters in the experiments. Including:

1. The parameter of the coin

2. The length of the sequence and the texture of the sequence (here you can try any sequence with out the assumption that you can only play A at time nq)

3. The episode of the experiment

4. The initial coin state


The result with be shown as a graph with P_R-P_L changing with the episode of the iteration.
